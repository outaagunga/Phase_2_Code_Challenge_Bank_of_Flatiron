# Phase_2_Code_Challenge_Bank_of_Flatiron

This is the Code Challenge for phase_2 week_1 on React fundamentals

Bank of Flatiron React Project
This project is a simple web application for managing transactions for the Bank of Flatiron.

Usage
Users can view transactions in a table, add new transactions, search for specific transactions, and optionally sort and delete transactions.

View Transactions
After installing and running the project, the main page will display a table with all the existing transactions. The table will include columns such as Date, Description, Amount, and other relevant information.

Add a Transaction
To add a new transaction, click on the "Add Transaction" button on the main page. You will be directed to a form where you can enter the transaction details, including the date, description, and amount. Once you submit the form, the new transaction will be added to the table.

Search Transactions
To search for specific transactions, utilize the search bar provided on the main page. You can search by date, description, or other relevant criteria. The table will dynamically update to display only the transactions that match your search query.

Sort Transactions
If you wish to sort the transactions, you can click on the column headers in the table. For example, clicking on the "Date" header will sort the transactions by date in ascending or descending order. Similarly, clicking on the "Amount" header will sort the transactions by amount.

Delete Transactions
If you need to remove a transaction from the system, simply locate the transaction in the table and click on the delete button (usually represented by an "X" icon). Confirm the deletion, and the transaction will be removed from the table.
